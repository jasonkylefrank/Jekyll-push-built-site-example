# Jekyll-push-built-site-example
Example site that uses Jekyll to build locally and then pushes the pre-built site to the gh-pages branch for GitHub to serve.

This approach allows you to:
  * Use Jekyll plugins (locally)
  * Use bower components without pushing those libraries to Github
  * Use Gulp (or similar) to compile your SASS files so you avoid having to add yaml front-matter to them
